      <p>
        We at Nogor always try to deliver our products in perfect condition. But
        sometimes things go wrong and you may receive a damaged or faulty
        product. Don’t worry, we have your back. You can return the product and
        get a replacement or a refund.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-lg lg:text-xl  font-bold">
        To be eligible for a return, you need to follow these steps:
      </h1>
      <p>Make sure the product is within 5-7 days of the order date.</p>
      <p>
        Keep the product unused and in its original condition with all the tags
        and packaging intact. Return any free promotional item that came with
        the product.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        We will arrange a pick up or guide you on how to send the product back
        to us. After we receive your return, we will check the product and
        confirm if it meets our return criteria. If it does, we will either

      <h1 class="text-lg lg:text-xl  font-bold">
        Refund Policy Your refund will depend on the following factors:
      </h1>
      <p>
        The availability of the product in stock. If the product is out of
        stock, you will get a full refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mode of payment you used. If you paid by Cash on Delivery (COD),
        there is no refund because you didn’t pay anything. If you paid by
        Credit Card, Debit Card, Mobile Banking or Bank Transfer, you will get a
        refund in your respective account.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deduction of the Cash on Delivery convenience charge and the
        shipping charge. These are non-refundable charges and will be deducted
        from your refund amount.
